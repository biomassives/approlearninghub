  <h1>Battle of the Raps: POAP & Knowledge Series</h1>

  <p>
    <strong>FaNa</strong> and the <span class="highlight">Art Life Group</span> are proud to present the <em>Battle of the Raps</em> POAP initiative—a digital proof-of-attendance and recognition system designed to celebrate, certify, and archive the skills and contributions of Kenyan hip hop artists and fans.
  </p>

  <h2>Ethical Core</h2>
  <p>
        <strong>FaNa</strong> and Muppy stand on the principles of community building and development of a legitimate long term benefit of blockchain use rather than hype and <A href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wash_trade">wash trading</a> focused market deveopment.
         Our efforts are dedicated to standing for people power- open source, decentralization, low energy use, and education to prevent scams.

  </p>

  <h2>What is a POAP?</h2>
  <p>
    A <strong>POAP</strong> (Proof of Attendance Protocol) is a collectible NFT issued to attendees of events, workshops, or key milestones. In this series, each POAP doubles as a digital credential—awarded to artists and fans who engage in curated learning modules and participate in battle events.
  </p>

  <h2>Why Mint on Solana?</h2>
  <p>
    We chose <span class="highlight">Solana</span> for its speed, low transaction costs, and robust NFT infrastructure. POAPs minted here are publicly visible, transferable, and forever verifiable.
  </p>

  <h2>How It Works</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Connect your <strong>Solflare wallet</strong> on the Solana Testnet.</li>
    <li>Complete a <span class="highlight">hip hop learning module</span> or participate in a battle event.</li>
    <li>Use the app to <strong>generate custom POAP art</strong> and mint it directly to your wallet.</li>
    <li>Explore all minted tokens via the <a href="/explorer.html">POAP Explorer</a>.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>About the Series</h2>
  <p>
    This initiative is part of Fa Na’s broader mission to preserve and elevate <strong>East African hip hop heritage</strong> through digital culture. From Karen to Kibera, each module reflects our community's rhythm, resilience, and creative brilliance.
