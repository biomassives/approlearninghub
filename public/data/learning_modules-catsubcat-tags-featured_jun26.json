          "4. **Moisture Control & Mold Prevention:** Design and build to prevent water intrusion. Ensure proper drainage, flashing, and vapor barriers. Maintain indoor humidity levels below 60% to inhibit mold growth. Address leaks immediately.",
          "5. **Ventilation & Airflow Design:** Incorporate effective natural ventilation (cross-ventilation, stack effect) or mechanical ventilation systems to ensure constant air changes and dilute indoor pollutants.",
          "6. **Proper Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) & Training:** Always use appropriate PPE (respirators for dust/fumes, gloves for chemicals, eye protection). Ensure users are properly trained in fitting and using PPE and understand its limitations. **Emphasize that improvised solutions are temporary and should be replaced by certified PPE where possible.**",
          "7. **Safe Handling & Disposal of Hazardous Materials:** Follow strict protocols for handling identified toxic materials. This often involves containment, proper disposal in designated hazardous waste facilities, and in many cases, professional abatement for lead and asbestos.",
          "8. **Post-Construction Airing & Testing:** Allow newly constructed or renovated spaces to air out for an extended period. Consider air quality testing (e.g., for VOCs, formaldehyde) before full occupancy, especially for vulnerable individuals."

          "**Phase 1: Water Pre-Treatment (Sedimentation & Coarse Filtration)**",
          "  1. **Source Assessment:** Identify your water source. Note turbidity (cloudiness) and any visible debris. Understand that no DIY filter makes water *safe* without subsequent disinfection.",
          "  2. **Initial Settling:** If water is very cloudy, allow it to sit in a separate container for several hours to let heavier sediments sink to the bottom. Carefully pour off the clearer water for filtration.",
          "  3. **Basic Pre-filtration:** Pass the water through a clean cloth (like a bandana or coffee filter) to remove larger particles (leaves, twigs, insects). This protects your main filter layers from clogging.",
          "**Phase 2: Constructing the Layered DIY Water Filter (Workshop Focus)**",
          "  4. **Prepare the Bottle:** Take a clean plastic bottle and cut off the bottom (the wider end) to create an opening for adding materials. Turn the bottle upside down, inserting its neck into your collection vessel.",
          "  5. **Layer 1 (Cotton/Cloth Plug):** Place a cotton ball or a folded piece of clean cloth tightly into the neck of the bottle. This acts as a barrier to keep the other layers from falling out and provides initial filtration.",
          "  6. **Layer 2 (Larger Rocks/Pebbles):** Add a 2-3 inch layer of washed larger pebbles. This layer helps drain water quickly and supports the layers above it. Ensure they are clean by rinsing them.",
          "  7. **Layer 3 (Small Gravel):** Add a 2-3 inch layer of washed small pea gravel. This reduces larger particles further. Rinse until clear before adding.",
          "  8. **Layer 4 (Coarse Sand):** Add a 2-3 inch layer of washed coarse sand. This fine filtration layer starts trapping smaller suspended solids. Rinse until clear before adding.",
          "  9. **Layer 5 (Fine Sand):** Add a 2-3 inch layer of washed fine sand. This is your primary physical filtration layer for very small particles. Rinse until clear before adding.",
          "  10. **Layer 6 (Activated Charcoal):** Add a 1-2 inch layer of activated charcoal (crushed, non-briquette type). This layer is crucial for absorbing chemicals, odors, and some dissolved impurities. It is generally recommended to wash the charcoal dust off before adding this layer to avoid black water coming out initially.",
          "  11. **Final Layer (Optional Top Cloth):** Place another clean piece of cloth or fine mesh on top of the charcoal layer to prevent filter material disturbance when pouring water.",
          "  12. **Initial Flush:** Slowly pour a few cups of clean water (or pre-filtered dirty water) through your newly constructed filter. The first few passes might appear cloudy or discolored from charcoal dust; discard this water until it runs clearer. This process also helps settle the layers.",
          "**Phase 3: Water Disinfection (Essential for Safety)**",
          "  13. **Crucial Safety Note:** Understand that DIY filters *only remove suspended particles* and improve clarity. They DO NOT remove bacteria, viruses, or chemical contaminants. Filtered water *must always be disinfected* before drinking.",
          "  14. **Boiling (Most Reliable):** Bring filtered water to a rolling boil for at least 1 minute (3 minutes at altitudes above 6,500 feet / 2,000 meters). Let it cool. This method kills most pathogens.",
          "  15. **Solar Disinfection (SODIS):** Fill clear PET plastic bottles with filtered water. Shake briefly. Lay bottles horizontally in direct sunlight for at least 6 hours on sunny days, or 2 days on cloudy days. UV-A radiation and heat kill pathogens. (Water temperature should reach at least 50°C for optimal results, but direct sunlight is key).",
          "  16. **Chemical Disinfection (Backup):** If boiling or SODIS is not feasible, use unscented household bleach. Add 2 drops of 5-6% sodium hypochlorite bleach per liter of filtered water. Stir and let stand for 30 minutes. A slight chlorine smell should be present; if not, repeat dose and wait another 15 minutes. (Refer to CDC guidelines for precise dosages based on bleach concentration).",
          "**Phase 4: Safe Storage & Maintenance**",
          "  17. **Store Safely:** Transfer purified water to clean, covered containers. Avoid re-contaminating with dirty hands or utensils.",
          "  18. **Filter Maintenance:** Over time, your layered filter will clog. Disassemble, clean, and replace layers as needed, especially the top coarse layers. Activated charcoal should be replaced regularly (e.g., every few weeks, depending on usage and water quality) as its absorptive capacity diminishes. The goal is to produce visibly clearer water for the disinfection step, not to make it microbiologically safe on its own."

      "   - Step 19: Simultaneous Digestate Removal (remove an equivalent volume of digestate as you feed to maintain liquid level)",

      "   - Step 21: Utilize Biogas Safely (connect to appliances, ensure good ventilation where gas is used)",
