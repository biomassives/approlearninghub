 {"id":"24","title":"Innovative Fog Harvesting: Clean Water Solution for Arid Regions","description":"Discover how fog harvesting is becoming a clean and effective way to collect water in water-scarce locations like Peru, Bolivia, and Morocco. Learn about the latest innovations in fog water collection and purification systems.","youtubeId":"exampleID123","transcript":"In some countries like Peru, Bolivia and Morocco, rainfall and spring water are scarce, making fog a vital water source. That's right, fog. Residents in these regions set up nets to capture droplets for daily use. This method yields significant water, collecting hundreds of litres daily from small net areas. But fog water contains atmospheric pollution, and requires treatment before use. That's the problem researchers are tackling. They've developed a fog water collection system that broke down 94% of added compounds in lab tests. The innovation involves metal wire structures coated with specialized polymers and titanium dioxide. As water trickles down the structure into a container, it's collected and cleaned simultaneously. The device is remarkably low maintenance after installation, needing only regular UV exposure. Just half an hour of sunlight can sustain the cleansing function for a full 24 hours. Researchers hope this invention will become a widely used tool to alleviate water scarcity.","rating":4.7,"creator":null,"host":null,"datePublished":"2023-09-19","createdAt":"2024-11-13T21:28:55.708114+00:00","updatedAt":"2024-11-13T21:28:55.708114+00:00","tags":"{\"fog harvesting\",\"water conservation\",\"sustainable technology\",\"arid regions\",\"water purification\"}","category":"water-conservation","subcategory":null,"status":null,"statusNote":null,"panels":null,"panels":[{"id": "42d4a21a-6441-4fe1-a3dc-d521d79e4820", "title": "Fog Harvesting Basics", "content": "Fog harvesting involves setting up nets or structures to capture water droplets from fog in areas where traditional water sources are scarce.

That's right, fog. Residents in these regions set up nets to capture droplets for daily use. This method yields significant water, collecting hundreds of litres daily from small net areas. But fog water contains atmospheric pollution, and requires treatment before use. That's the problem researchers are tackling. They've developed a fog water collection system that broke down 94% of added compounds in lab tests. The innovation involves metal wire structures coated with specialized polymers and titanium dioxide. As water trickles down the structure into a container, it's collected and cleaned simultaneously. The device is remarkably low maintenance after installation, needing only regular UV exposure. Just half an hour of sunlight can sustain the cleansing function for a full 24 hours. Researchers hope this invention will become a widely used tool to alleviate water scarcity.","rating":4.7,"creator":null,"host":null,"datePublished":"2023-09-19","createdAt":"2024-11-13T21:28:55.708114+00:00","updatedAt":"2024-11-13T21:28:55.708114+00:00","tags":"{\"fog harvesting\",\"water conservation\",\"sustainable technology\",\"arid regions\",\"water purification\"}","category":"water-conservation","subcategory":null,"status":null,"statusNote":null,"panels":null,"panels":[{"id": "42d4a21a-6441-4fe1-a3dc-d521d79e4820", "title": "Fog Harvesting Basics", "content": "Fog harvesting involves setting up nets or structures to capture water droplets from fog in areas where traditional water sources are scarce.

In fact, building with earth and natural fibres is a technique used in many places around the world.  This style of construction can have different names, like earth building, adobe, mud bricks, etc.\n\nUnlike conventional buildings, cob is a simple way to build that can be an interesting and easy option to build a DIY green home using little, if any, toxic materials.\n\nBryce teaches natural building and cob workshops in person and online.  You can find out more about his courses on his website here:\nhttp://www.dreamweaverscollective.org/\n\nHe calls himself a 3rd generation cobber because he learned cob building techniques from Pat Hennebery at Cobworks: https://www.cobworks.com/ \n\nAnd Pat learned about cob from Ianto Evans, Linda Smiley, and the rest of the team at The Cob Cottage Company: http://www.cobcottage.com/\n\nWe hope you enjoyed learning about this interesting, natural, affordable, and alternative building technique :)  We think cob houses are incredible and beautiful structures!\n\nPhotos taken by Bryce and Kelly from Dreamweavers Collective.\n\nDome & arch photos taken at Arcosanti:\nhttps://arcosanti.org/\n\nThe Cob Cottage and other cob houses built by Cobworks:\nhttps://www.cobworks.com/ \n\nWhite cob cabin built by Terra Perma:\nhttps://terraperma.ca/en/\n\nThanks for watching!\n\nMat & Danielle\n\nThank you to all of our Patrons who support us so generously and a very special thank you to our backbone supporters: The Burgess Family and Jakob Dannesboe!\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------\nSTAY IN TOUCH!\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBlog: www.exploringalternatives.ca\nFacebook: /exploringalternativesblog\nInstagram: @exploringalternatives\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------\nCOMMENTS\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWe want our channel and our comments section to be an inclusive space where everyone feels welcome to watch and to contribute.

Kat Lavers is a permaculture designer and educator, with a small-scale but very productive space. On a mere 96m2, the garden produces an abundance of edible crops every season. And what's a smaller alternative to chooks? 3:34 Quails of course! \n\nKat moved into her house ‘The Plummery’ in 2008. Apart from an old Blood Plum (Prunus cv.), the garden was a mass of weeds with contaminated soil and marauding possums. 0:41 With above acceptable levels of lead in the soil originating from peeling house paint, Kat built three raised vegetable beds.\n\nKat: “I am going to live here for a long time, and eat many kilos of produce from my garden, so it’s important I know what is in my soil, both in terms of contamination and nutrients.”\n\n1:14 Kat rotates her edible crops across the 3 raised garden beds. For ease of use, they are all the same size - the trellis system she uses can be moved from one bed to another. The beds are easy to net, water, work on and harvest. “I can easily reach into the middle of the bed from either side, and even though the garden is small, I leave one metre wide paths for my wheelbarrow to get through.”\n\nThe fruit trees, including a persimmon, plum and pear are kept small and pruned regularly to promote continuous cropping throughout the year, and to make the most of the smaller site.   The fruiting grapevine shades the back of house and seating area, and provides shade for the vegie beds too. “The garden is designed so the vegies get some shade and wind protection during hot summer days.”\n\nKat is methodical. She keeps a diary tracking her plantings and recording all produce picked. In 2016 the garden produced 350 kg of herbs, fruit and vegetables. In 2018 this was well over 400kg. “The diary is my most important tool for increasing productivity!” Kat explained.  From record keeping, she now has a preferred list of what is best to plant in her small garden.\n\nKat favours vegies that are easy to grow such as silverbeet, and give back more than she puts in. Perennial vegetables are high on the list - perennial leeks, chokos and wild rocket (Diplotaxis tenuifolia) – as they keep on giving.  It should be noted that Diplotaxis tenuifolia can be invasive in many parts of Australia, and local invasive species listings should be checked prior to planting this variety.\n\n3:34 Quails\nA small-scale garden doesn’t mean you can’t have poultry to lay eggs and provide fertiliser. You just need to think small – quails! “Quails a fantastic alternative in urban areas where soil contamination, space and noise constraints may limit a flock of chickens” says Kat.\n\nKat’s Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica) are kept in a semi indoor coop on a concrete base with “deep litter”. You can use wood shavings, wood chips, autumn leaves, shredded paper and cardboard, which is eventually used as compost.  \n\n\nWatch Gardening Australia on ABC iview: http://iview.abc.net.au/programs/gard... \n \nSUBSCRIBE: http://ab.co/GardeningYouTube \n \nAbout Gardening Australia: \nGardening Australia is an ABC TV program providing gardening know-how and inspiration.

While I typically recommend using a 48V system for efficiency and simplicity, I understand that some of you already have a 12V inverter and need to make it work. That's why in this video, I'll break down everything you need to know to get your 12V system up and running effectively.\n\nWe’ll start with the basics: understanding your inverter's efficiency and how it impacts the power your batteries need to supply. A 3000W inverter can deliver up to 3000 watts of power to your appliances, but it’s important to note that inverters aren’t 100% efficient. In fact, most operate at around 90% efficiency. This means that your batteries need to supply more than 3000W to account for the energy lost during the conversion process. I’ll walk you through the math and explain how this affects your battery requirements.\n\nNext, we'll dive into battery selection. For those using lithium batteries, I'll explain why these are generally the best choice for off-grid systems. I’ll calculate exactly how many 12V lithium batteries you need, depending on their capacity, to reliably power your 3000W inverter. For instance, if you're using 12V 100Ah lithium batteries, you’ll need three of them in parallel to meet your power needs. If you have larger 12V 200Ah lithium batteries, two in parallel will suffice. I’ll break down the calculations step-by-step to make it easy to follow.\n\nAfter covering the batteries, we'll move on to wiring and fusing. This is a critical part of your setup, especially with a 12V system where high currents are involved. I’ll explain how to size your wires and fuses correctly to prevent overheating and other issues. You’ll learn why it’s sometimes necessary to use thicker cables or even multiple cables in parallel to handle the current safely. I’ll also show you a diagram that outlines the wire and fuse sizes needed for different setups, including how to split the current across multiple wires to make your installation easier and safer.\n\nAnd for those of you considering a 48V or 24V system, I’ll explain why I typically recommend a 48V system for a 3000W inverter. With a 48V system, you can reduce the current, simplify your wiring, and even save on costs in the long run. I’ll show you the wire and fuse sizes needed for a 48V setup and compare it to what you’d need for a 24V system, so you can see the advantages for yourself.\n\nI’ll provide some tips on how to connect your batteries to a busbar, why fusing each battery individually is a good safety practice, and how to choose the right busbar for your high-current system. \n\nBut what if you’re using lead-acid batteries? Lead-acid batteries have different characteristics and limitations compared to lithium. I'll discuss the concept of C-rate, which is crucial for understanding how much current you can safely draw from lead-acid batteries without drastically reducing their lifespan. To power a 3000W inverter with lead-acid batteries, you’d need a whopping 13 batteries in parallel! I'll explain why this setup is much less efficient and more cumbersome compared to a lithium setup, and why you might want to consider upgrading to lithium if you haven’t already.","youtubeId":"38hPUBjoY7g","transcript":null,"rating":null,"creator":null,"host":null,"datePublished":"2025-01-18","createdAt":"2025-01-18T17:11:28.351+00:00","updatedAt":"2025-01-18T17:11:28.351+00:00","tags":"[\"critical-skills\"]","category":"energysolutions","subcategory":"diy-solar","status":null,"statusNote":null,"panels":null,"panels":[]},
